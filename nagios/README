Copyright (c) 2014 VoltDB Inc. All rights reserved. 

Nagios plugins for monitoring VoltDB:

    check_voltdb_cluster
    check_voltdb_memory
    check_voltdb_ports
    check_voltdb_replication
    

Other tools:

    get_voltdb_statistics   Handy tool for getting statistics from VoltDB into csv/tsv.


Required perl modules (also see the module header for more information):

    JSON-2.53
    JSON::Path-0.201
    LWP::UserAgent
    Getopt::Std-1.07
    DateTime


This is what we suggest:

Monitor each of your VoltDB instances with the check_voltdb_ports. This will give you an alert if any instance dies.
(This is a redundant check if you are using any other checks.)

Optionally, monitor each instance memory usage with check_voltdb_memory. This checks the memory used by VoltDB on 
the host that the check is done against only. If you are also using the ports check, tell nagios that check memory
is dependent on check port. Select a warning and/or critical threshold(s) and pass those as arguments to the plugin.

Optionally, for k-safe clusters, monitor each VoltDB node with check_voltdb_cluster. This is a cluster wide check that 
can run on any node(s). This will give you an alert if any node(s) are down in the cluster (i.e. cluster is not optimal).

Optionally, if you are using replication, monitor the status of replication with check_voltdb_replication. This is a node
check made on master and replica nodes that will give you an alert if replication falls behind or fails. Replica nodes
are normally not checked, but this can be overridden by a command line option. By default, the plugin will report  a warning
when replication is forced to spill to disk and critical when replication has failed (or is not running), but you can 
override this behavior and select warning and critical limits expressed in bytes backlogged. The plugin will also give an
alert if the replication agent has not been heard from for more than an interval of your choosing (default is 120 sec).


We tested under Ubuntu 10.04 with Perl 5.14.2

Happy monitoring!
